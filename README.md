## What is Thalassemia?

Currently, thalassaemia has become a worldwide public health problem.

Thalassemia is a congenital anemia with shortened red blood cell life span due to abnormalities in the quantity and quality of hemoglobin in red blood cells, and severe patients often rely on expensive blood transfusion and iron discharge treatment.

They need to rely on bone marrow donations to be truly freed from suffering of the disease.But their matching bone marrow is often difficult to obtain.

And most of them had to enter sterile cabins in their childhood, being separated from their parents and not entering school like their peers.
